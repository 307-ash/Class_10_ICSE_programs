Prog. 1 | Write a program in Java to input a character. Find and display the next 10th character in the ASCII table.

Prog. 2 | Write a program in Java to input character. Display next 5 characters.

Prog. 3 | Write a program in Java to generate all the alternate letters in the range of letters from A to Z.

Prog. 4 | Write a program to input a set of 20 letters. Convert each letter into upper case. Find and dispaly the number of vowels and number of consonants present in the set of given letters.

Prog. 5 | Write a program in Java to accept an integer number N such that 0<N<27. Display the corresponding a letter of the alphabet (i.e., the letter at position N).
        | HINT: if N = 1 then display A.

Prog. 6 | Write a program to input two characters from the keyboard. Find the difference (d) between their ASCII codes. Display the following messages: 
        | if d = 0      : both the characters are same.
        | if d < 0      : first character is smaller.
        | if d > 0      : second character is smaller.
        | Sample Input  :D
        |                P
        | Sample Output :d = (68 - 80) = -12
        |                First character is smalller

Prog. 7 | Write a program to input a set of any 10 integer numbers. Find the sum and products of the numbers. Join the sum and product to form a single number. Display the concatenated number.
        | HINT: let the sum = 245 and product = 1346 then the number after joining sum and product will be 2451346

Prog. 8 | Write a menu driven program to generate the uppercase letters from Z to A and lowercase letters from a to z as per the user's choice.
        | Enter 1 to display uppercase letters from Z to A and Enter 2 to display lowercase letters from a to z.

Prog. 9 | Write a program to input a letter. Find its ASCII code. Reverse the ASCII code and display the equivalent character.
        | Sample Input: Y
        | Sample Output: ASCII Code = 89
        | Reverse the code = 98
        | Equivalent character: b

Prog. 10| Write a menu driven program to display
        | (a) first five uppercase letters
        | (b) last five lowercase letters as per the user's choice. Enter 1 to display uppercase letters and enter 2 to display lowercase letters.

Prog. 11| Using switch case statement, write a menu driven program to perform the following tasks:
        | (a) To generate and print the letters from A to Z along with their Unicode.
        |  Letters                  Unicode
        |  A                        65
        |  B                        66
        |  .....                    .....
        |  .....                    .....
        |  Z                        90
        | 
        | (b) To generate and print the letters from z to a along with their Unicode.
        |  Letters                  Unicode
        |  z                        122
        |  y                        121
        |  .....                    .....
        |  .....                    .....
        |  a                        97

        |  (a) A
        |      ab 
        |      ABC
        |      abcd
        |      ABCDE
        |
